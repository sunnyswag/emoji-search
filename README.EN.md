## üïê Project  Timeline Introduction

![emoji-search-app-sequence-diagram](./assets/emoji-search-app.drawio.png)

The construction of the project is divided into two parts, preparing data and building the Android APP. The specific steps are as follows:

- Data preparation
  - Use Python to parse and get Emoji data
  - Send POST request to OpenAI to get Emoji Embedding data
  - Save Emoji data as a Json formatted file
  - Copy the data to the Android APP, and convert the data into the format of Protocol Buffers
- Build Android APP
  - Load Emoji data into memory
  - Process user input and get user input Embeddings
  - Perform dot product operation with Embeddings and Emoji Embeddings, and get the top 20 most relevant Emojis

## üì± APP Experience

1. Download the experience APP from the [release](https://github.com/sunnyswag/emoji-search/releases/tag/v1.1.0) page
2. Install it on your phone, turn on scientific internet access, and make sure you can access ChatGPT

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository to local

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/sunnyswag/emoji-search.git
   ```

2. Prepare data (use data from this [release](https://github.com/sunnyswag/emoji-search/releases/tag/v1.0.1-beta), you can skip this step)

   * Export OpenAI Key to the environment variable

     ```shell
     # Windows
     $Env:OPENAI_KEY = "your_openai_key"
     # Mac or Linux
     export OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_key
     ```

   * Install relevant Python dependencies in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/sunnyswag/emoji-search/blob/main/Python/requirements.txt)

     ```shell
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   * Set command line proxy

     ```shell
     set http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7890
     set https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7890
     ```

   * Run [build_emoji_data.py](https://github.com/sunnyswag/emoji-search/blob/main/Python/build_emoji_data.py) to get the processed json.gz file

     ```shell
     python ./build_emoji_data.py
     ```

   * Convert json.gz data to Protocol Buffer format

     Copy json.gz data to Android Project

     Modify AppInitializer.kt in Android as follows:

     ```Kotlin
     private suspend fun readEmojiEmbeddings(context: Context) {
         ProcessorFactory.doProcess(
             context,
             ProcessorType.JSON_TO_PROTOBUF_PROCESSOR,
             listOf(R.raw.emoji_embeddings_json)
         )
     }
     ```

3. Run Android APP

   * Put Emoji Embedding data into the res/raw folder and specify the corresponding data type in AppInitializer.kt:

     ```kotlin
     private suspend fun readEmojiEmbeddings(context: Context) {
         ProcessorFactory.doProcess(
             context,
             // Use protobuf for loading
             ProcessorType.PROTOBUF_PROCESSOR,
             listOf(R.raw.emoji_embeddings_proto)
         )
     }
     ```

## üìù TODO

- [ ] Train Mobile-Bert to replace OpenAI Embedding API
- [ ] Add Emoji search history
- [ ] Enable R8 compilation to reduce package size
- [ ] Upload to Google Play
